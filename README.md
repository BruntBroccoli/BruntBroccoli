📊 Hi, I’m Lilian — a data analyst blending curiosity, automation & storytelling.
This GitHub is where I share the behind-the-scenes of my data projects — from visual storytelling in Power BI to Python automations and AI-assisted builds. Most of these projects were born from a mix of personal curiosity, career hurdles, and the joy of building things that make life (and work) a little easier.

Some themes you’ll find here:

🧠 Data storytelling & dashboard design

🤖 No-code AI agents & Python automations

🧩 Explorations in brand strategy, media mix modeling, and customer experience

🐾 Fun side projects

All work-in-progress, all shared with intention.

If you’re curious about the why or how behind what’s here, head over to my Substack where I write about my learning journey, career growth, and the beautiful mess of building in public.
